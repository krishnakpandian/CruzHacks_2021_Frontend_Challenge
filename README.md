This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## This is My CruzHacks 2021 Frontend Development challenge with some backend
## Email me @ kpandian@ucsc.edu for the API keys and place into firebase.js etc if you want to run this locally or you can import your own API keys
I am running this on Node v10.15.1

You can view the backend content via
## 'curl "https://firestore.googleapis.com/v1/projects/cruzhacks2021-pandian-db/databases/(default)/documents/getHackerInfo?key=AIzaSyBJoxuui9gVJpVh_Pl2u0tXyYXQEajP2CQ" ' The quotations marks matter

## You can git clone on the repository and run npm install to retreive node modules
## Use npm start to run the project in localhost:3000 or npm test to run the test script
## You can also view it here on this AWS app https://master.d37os29dr4uuoh.amplifyapp.com/ if it doesn't work for any reason
## Available Scripts

I decided to add a little backend to this challenge due to the number of exams I have this week and that I am still new to the backend I thought it would be best to study for those and show some of the backend skills I have while not doing the challenge entirely (I.e it's not a complete backend challenge)

I used some of my old code from this repository as a starter
https://github.com/krishnakpandian/Application_Login hence the really offset dates. However, you can see that there isn't much overlap between the final product and this repository.

I also ran into a weird issue after deploying the web app where the predicted screen using inspect element wasn't accurate of the screen displayed (specifically the styling on the radio buttons) but otherwise everything seems to be working so you can test this on mobile.

In the project directory, you can run this Web App on Localhost:3000 by using NPM Start
Some Code in this project was reused from my own previous projects
### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
